# Measuring the Quality of a Match

This paper reviews the challenges associated with measuring match quality. We first review measures commonly used in the literature, their advantages and drawbacks. We then present novel evidence from a survey sample of US employees where alternative measures were collected simultaneously. We show that while some of these measures correlate well, others do not. Finally, we present more partial evidence on correlations between measures based on the larger and more representative sample of Understanding Society.
